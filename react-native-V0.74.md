# Yoga 3.0

Let's understand first what **yoga** is in React Native.

### Yoga â€” the layout engine

Yoga is an open-source **layout engine** developed by Meta. The engine which refers to **how UI elements** (such as buttons, text, images, etc.) are **arranged** and **positioned** within a user interface.

Yoga calculates these four for each UI element.

1.  **Positioning**

2.  **Sizing**

3.  **Alignment**

4.  **Spacing**

With **Yoga**, you can create **responsive layouts** that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. It also implements a widely used concept called **CSS Flexbox** in React Native. So you already feel that yoga is the heart (â™¥ï¸Ž) of React Native flexible UI.
